Documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win32user

Now it's time to install Visual Code, a sophisticated text editor made for the Microsoft environment, on the road for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download/" target="_blank">Visual Code for Windows</a> and run the installer. Go with the default installation options, unless you really know you want to change something.

Once installed, you can use the Start Menu to launch Visual Code.
